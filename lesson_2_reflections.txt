#What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git folder is created for my commits. It needs to be initilized so git can
record commits and other data.

#How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
#repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an area to organize your commits. The working directory
is the directory you're working in. The staging area's value is allowing you to
logically seperate commits after some work is done. Even if it made sense to 
complete the work together, or you forgot to commit at a good point, commiting
together may not make logical sense.
