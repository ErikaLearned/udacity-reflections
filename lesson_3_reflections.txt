#When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
#work local?
Allows for ease of sharing and for you to work from a variety of places. 
Portability and shareability.

#Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
#automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Control. You may not want the changes that have been made for reasons such as
the change not being your change. You also don't want to go back to your
project and not realize changes have happened while you were away. Doing it
manually ensures you know changes happened.
